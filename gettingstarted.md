# Getting started with Voice Gateway for Watson
IBM&reg; WebSphere&reg;  Connect Voice Gateway for Watson&trade; is deployed as part of an overall architecture that depends on the following factors:
 * **Type of assistance:** Are you implementing a self-service agent or an agent assistant? Learn more about these options and their architectures in [About Voice Gateway for Watson](about.md).
 * **Deployment location:** Where are you deploying the voice gateway? For each implementation, you can either deploy the voice gateway on the cloud using IBM&reg; Containers for Bluemix&reg;, or you can deploy the voice gateway on-premises or in a Docker Engine.

The following guides will help you quickly get started with a basic configuration for your chosen implementation and deployment location.
