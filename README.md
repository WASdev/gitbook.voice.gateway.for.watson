# Introduction to Voice Gateway for Watson Beta

IBM&reg; WebSphere&reg; Connect Voice Gateway for Watson&trade; Beta provides a way to integrate a set of orchestrated Watson services with a public or private telephone network using the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP).

You can implement the voice gateway in two different ways:
* As a cognitive _self-service agent_, which directly interacts with customers over a telephone
* As a cognitive _agent assistant_, which transcribes and analyzes a conversation for real-time agent feedback

Learn more about both of these uses in [About Voice Gateway for Watson](about.md).

### See it in action

Sometimes seeing is believing. Watch demonstrations of both the self-service agent and agent assistant in the following video.
