# Introduction to Voice Gateway for Watson Beta

IBM&reg; WebSphere&reg; Connect Voice Gateway for Watson&trade; provides a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) gateway into a set of orchestrated Watson services to automate or assist customer interactions. The voice gateway makes it possible to integrate a public or enterprise telephony system with Watson enabling direct voice interactions with a cognitive self-service agent or the ability to run real-time analytics on a phone call between two people (e.g.  a customer and a contact center agent).
