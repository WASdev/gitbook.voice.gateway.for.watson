# Introduction to Voice Gateway for Watson Beta

IBM&reg; WebSphere&reg; Connect Voice Gateway for Watson&trade; provides a way to integrate a set of orchestrated Watson services with a public or private telephone network using the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). The voice gateway enables direct voice interactions over a telephone with a cognitive self-service agent or the ability to transcribe a phone call between a caller and agent in real-time, enabling the ability to process the conversation with analytics for real-time agent feedback.
